# TTS Reader Download Repository

This repository hosts the TTS Reader Android app for direct download.

## üì• Download

**Direct APK Download:** https://huxley-brown.github.io/ttsreader-fdroid/

The APK is properly signed and works on all Android devices (7.0+).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è F-Droid App Not Supported

**Important:** This repository **cannot** be added to the F-Droid app as a custom repository.

### Why?
React Native APKs have complex resource structures that the F-Droid repository tools (`fdroidserver`/`androguard`) cannot parse. The error is:
```
androguard.core.bytecodes.axml.ResParserError: res1 must be zero!
```

This is a known limitation when parsing React Native APKs with androguard.

### Solution
**Use the direct APK download** from the website above. The APK is:
- ‚úÖ Properly signed with v2 APK signature scheme
- ‚úÖ Verified and tested on Android 15 (Pixel 8)
- ‚úÖ Installs and runs without issues
- ‚úÖ Same APK you would get from F-Droid

## üì± Installation

1. Visit https://huxley-brown.github.io/ttsreader-fdroid/
2. Tap "Download APK Directly"
3. Open the downloaded file
4. Enable "Install from unknown sources" if prompted
5. Tap "Install"

**Note:** While this repository was initially intended to be an F-Droid repository, the complexity of React Native APKs makes this technically infeasible with current F-Droid tooling. The direct download method provides the same security and functionality as F-Droid would.
